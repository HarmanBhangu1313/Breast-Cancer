# Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project implements a **Logistic Regression model** to classify whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on the features of the **Breast Cancer dataset**.  

The dataset is widely used in medical machine learning research and provides various cell nucleus features to aid in breast cancer diagnosis.

##  Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading** – Import the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand feature distribution and correlations.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Normalize and split dataset into training and test sets.
4. **Model Training** – Train a Logistic Regression classifier.
5. **Evaluation** – Evaluate model accuracy and performance metrics.

##  Features
- Uses **Logistic Regression** for binary classification.
- Evaluates model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Easy to extend with other models for comparison.
